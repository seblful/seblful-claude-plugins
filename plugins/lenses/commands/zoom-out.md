I don't know this area of code well. Go up a layer of abstraction. Give me a map of all the relevant modules and callers.

Name things the way the project names them. Take the vocabulary from whatever the project actually has — a `CONTEXT.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, an architecture doc or ADRs if they exist; otherwise from the code itself: module and type names, the domain nouns that recur across the area. Never invent a glossary the project doesn't use.
