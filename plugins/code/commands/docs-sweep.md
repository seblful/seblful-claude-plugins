# Docs Sweep

Make a project's docs short, focused, and worth reading — **plan first, apply only on approval**.

Sweep every markdown doc a human reads. `$ARGUMENTS` narrows it to a file or subtree; the process is the same.

**Scope: prose outside the code.** Docstrings and comments belong to `/code-sweep`. Leave agent-facing instructions alone. Never edit generated output — name the source that needs the change instead.

## Phase 0 — Inventory

Load the `writing-docs` skill. List the docs in scope with their line counts, excluding generated, vendored, and agent-facing files. Read a few neighbouring docs for the project's conventions: heading style, voice, where docs live and what they are called.

For each doc write one line: **its reader and the question it answers.** A doc you cannot write that line for is a split, a merge, or a delete.

**Output:** the inventory — doc, lines, reader, question.

## Phase 1 — Give each doc a verdict

Read every doc in full yourself. Past ~15 docs, fan out to `Explore` agents **by group of docs, never by concern** — duplication across docs is invisible to an agent that sees one file.

| Verdict | Means |
| --- | --- |
| **Keep** | already earns its lines |
| **Tighten** | cut and reshape — same doc, same question |
| **Split** | two readers or two questions — name each new doc and its question |
| **Merge** | fold into a named doc that answers the same question |
| **Delete** | answers nothing a reader asks, or only restates the code |

Split and Merge include tightening. **Name the cuts by section and by `writing-docs` category** — "reduce verbosity" is not a plan.

**Output:** a verdict and a cut list per doc.

## Phase 2 — Present the plan, then stop

One numbered item per doc that changes, entry point first, then by lines saved, so the user can answer "do 1, 3, 4":

- **Title** — imperative, names the doc: "Split `setup.md` into install and configuration"
- **Verdict**, and **lines now → expected**
- **Cut** — what goes, a few words each
- **Moves** — for a split or merge: new files, what lands where, links to update
- **Corrections** — any kept line whose meaning must change to match the repo, as old → new. Never bury one inside a rewrite.
- **Flagged** — kept lines you could not verify

Close with the Keep docs on one line and the total lines now → expected.

**Then stop and ask which items to apply.** Edit nothing before an answer.

## Phase 3 — Apply, one doc at a time

1. **Move, never lose.** Every fact a reader needs survives somewhere. A cut removes noise, never the only copy of something true.
2. **Fix every link** into and out of what was split, merged, moved, or deleted.
3. **Match the project's form**, not your preference — style-only churn hides the real change in the diff.
4. **Apply only what was approved.** New ideas go in the report as follow-ups.
5. **Never run a doc's commands to check them** — they can install, delete, or deploy. Read the repo instead. Never edit code from here.

## Phase 4 — Report

- [ ] Docs changed — verdict and lines before → after each, plus the total
- [ ] Files created, merged, or deleted, and links updated
- [ ] Corrections, as old → new
- [ ] Approved items not applied, and why
- [ ] Flagged lines still unverified
- [ ] Follow-ups, and anything handed to `/code-sweep`

Do not commit unless asked.
