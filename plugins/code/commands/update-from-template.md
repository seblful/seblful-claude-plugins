# Update From Template

Bring a project back in line with the [Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/) template it was generated from. `copier update` does the mechanical three-way merge and stops at the first thing it cannot decide; **this command owns everything after that** — the conflict markers, the `.rej` hunks, and the gates that prove the result still works.

`$ARGUMENTS`, if given, is the template ref to move to (`v0.7.7`, `HEAD`). Omit it for the latest tag, which is what Copier picks by default.

**Nothing here is tied to one template, one language, or one toolchain.** The template URL comes from the project's own answers file, so this works on any Copier subproject; the gates come from the project's own build config; the conflict table is keyed by what a file *does*, not what it is called. Where a worked example is needed it uses a Python/`uv` project, because that is the stack with the most moving parts — read it as an illustration of the rule above it, never as the rule itself.

## Prerequisites

- **A way to run Copier.** `uvx --with jinja2-time copier` needs nothing installed globally and is what every command below uses; `pipx run copier` or a global install work the same way. This is only how Copier itself is launched — it says nothing about what language the *project* is written in. Whichever you use, include the template's own Jinja extensions: `jinja2-time` is not optional for a template that stamps the current year into a LICENSE, and a template declaring others fails the same way.
- **A git repo with a clean working tree.** Copier refuses to update a dirty destination, and without a clean state there is no abort point.
- Run everything from the project root.

## Phase 0 — Find the link, then take a baseline

**The link.** Look for the answers file at the project root: `.copier-answers.yml`, or `.copier-answers.*.yml` when the project tracks more than one template. Two keys matter:

| Key | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `_src_path` | the template — a `gh:owner/name` shorthand, or any git URL |
| `_commit` | the template version the project last synced to |

No answers file → **the project predates the template.** Go to Phase 5. Do not hand-write an answers file to force `copier update` — Copier's own docs say never to edit that file by hand, and the merge it produces is against a rendering the project never matched.

**The target.** Resolve where you are going — `gh api repos/<owner>/<name>/tags --jq '.[].name'` for a `gh:` path, `git ls-remote --tags <url>` otherwise. Default is the newest tag; `$ARGUMENTS` overrides. If `_commit` already equals the target, say so and stop.

**The preview.** Show what the template changed *before* touching anything:

```
gh api repos/<owner>/<name>/compare/<_commit>...<target> --jq '.files[] | "\(.status) \(.filename)"'
```

Group it by what it touches — dependencies, tooling config, package source, tests, assistant instructions — and list the commit subjects. This is the user's chance to say "not now".

**The baseline.** Run the project's gates *now*, before the update, and record each as green or red. **Discover them; do not assume a stack.** Read the project's build config and its assistant instructions (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`), and take the commands they actually name. Five roles matter, in this order — skip any the project doesn't have:

| Gate | Where to find the command |
| --- | --- |
| Install / sync dependencies | the package manager the lockfile implies |
| Lint | the lint config at the project root |
| Type-check | the type-checker config, if the language has one |
| Test | the test runner's config or the CI workflow |
| Pre-commit / hooks | `.pre-commit-config.yaml` or the repo's hook runner |

A Python project on a `uv` stack, for example, resolves them to `uv sync`, `uv run ruff check .`, `uv run ty check src/ tests/`, `uv run pytest -v`, `uv run pre-commit run --all-files`. A Node project resolves the same five roles to its own commands. **Write down whatever you resolved — Phase 3 re-runs exactly these.**

**A red baseline is not a blocker — it is the control.** Without it you will blame the template for a failure the project already had.

## Phase 1 — Branch, then update

```
git switch -c chore/template-update-<target>
git rev-parse HEAD          # record it — this is your abort point
```

Then:

```
uvx --with jinja2-time copier update --trust --defaults --conflict inline
```

| Flag | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `--trust` | the template runs Jinja extensions and `_tasks`; Copier refuses without it |
| `--defaults` | reuse every stored answer and take the template's default for questions added since — the non-interactive form |
| `--conflict inline` | git-style markers in place, both sides visible where the code is. `--conflict rej` instead collects rejected hunks in `.rej` files and leaves each file syntactically valid — switch to it if the markers are too tangled to work in |
| `--vcs-ref=<ref>` | only when `$ARGUMENTS` names one; otherwise Copier takes the newest tag, not `HEAD` |
| `--data key=value` | change a stored answer in the same run — a new runtime version, a different license. No interactive session needed |

**Expect the template's own tasks to fail, and do not re-run.** A template whose `_tasks` format or lint the project — `ruff format .`, `ruff check --fix .`, `mdformat .` — runs them *after* the merge, and none of those can parse a file with conflict markers in it. Copier reports the task failure; the merged files are already on disk. Carry on to Phase 2. Re-running from a now-dirty tree only fails differently.

**Abort** at any point: `git reset --hard <recorded sha>` then `git clean -fd`.

## Phase 2 — Resolve what Copier could not

Find every one:

```
grep -rln "^<<<<<<<" . --exclude-dir=.git
find . -name "*.rej" -not -path "./.git/*"
```

**The rule: the project wins on content, the template wins on shape.** The template owns how the project is built — rule sets, tool tables, module skeletons, hook versions. The project owns what it actually is — its dependencies, its prose, its settings fields, its commands, its tests. A hunk that mixes both gets merged, never resolved by picking a side wholesale.

Two corollaries:

- **Lists union, they do not choose.** Dependencies, ruff `select`, pre-commit repos, gitignore lines, env keys — take both sides.
- **Deliberate divergence is the trap.** A pinned older dependency, a disabled lint rule, a rewritten `settings.py`: where the template now changes exactly the thing the project changed on purpose, do not silently adopt the template. Check `git log -- <file>` for why, and ask if the answer is not there.

Resolve by the **role** a file plays, not its name — every ecosystem has all of these under different spellings:

| Role | Example | How it resolves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Package manifest | `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml` | Union. Keep every real dependency the project added and its own identity (name, description, version, scripts); take the template's tool-config tables whole. |
| Lockfile | `uv.lock`, `package-lock.json` | Neither side. Delete the conflict and regenerate it with the manager in Phase 3. |
| Hook / CI config | `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `.github/workflows/*` | Union of hooks and jobs; take the template's version bumps. |
| Assistant instructions | `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` | Template sections describe the stack — take them. Project sections describe *this* project — keep them intact. Never let a template default overwrite a real instruction. |
| Wired-in source skeleton | the settings, logging, and entry-point modules | Take the template's new shape, then re-apply the project's own config fields, processors and commands on top. These grow project-specific code fastest. |
| Test scaffolding | `conftest.py`, test setup files | Take the template's fixtures and helpers; keep every project test. |
| Ignore / env / version pins | `.gitignore`, `.env*`, `.python-version`, `.nvmrc` | Union. Never drop a project-specific ignore or env key, and never let a template placeholder overwrite a real local value. |
| README | `README.md` | The project's, always. Take only genuinely new template sections — a new command, a new gate. |
| Answers file | `.copier-answers.yml` | Copier's, untouched. It records the new `_commit`; that file *is* the update. |

Anything genuinely ambiguous goes to the user with **both candidate resolutions named** — not a guess, and not a silent choice.

When you are done, delete every `.rej` file you applied and re-run both searches until they come back empty. **A left-behind marker is a broken project**, not a stray comment.

## Phase 3 — Verify

Run the formatters the template's `_tasks` could not (whatever the template invokes — e.g. `uv run ruff format .`, `uv run mdformat .`), regenerate any lockfile you deleted in Phase 2, then re-run the Phase 0 gates in order.

- **Red where the baseline was green → the update caused it.** Fix it.
- **Red where the baseline was red → inherited.** Confirm you did not make it worse, and do not fold an unrelated pre-existing fix into this change.
- **A new lint or type error from a rule the template just added is a real finding.** Fix the code. Do not disable the rule to reach green unless the user says so.

Iterate until the gates match or beat the baseline.

## Phase 4 — Report

- **Version** — `_commit` → target, with the template's commit subjects.
- **What the template changed**, grouped: dependencies, tooling config, package source, tests, assistant instructions.
- **Conflicts resolved** — one line each: file, what the template wanted, what the project wanted, what you did.
- **Surfaced, not resolved** — every ambiguity left to the user, with both candidates.
- **Answers newly defaulted** — any question the template added that `--defaults` answered on the user's behalf, so they can override it with `--data`.
- **Gates** — baseline vs. now.

Do not commit unless asked. The branch and the abort SHA stay as they are.

## Phase 5 — Adoption: a project with no answers file

A project that predates the template has no common ancestor, so **`copier update` has nothing to merge against.** Build the ancestor instead of faking it:

**0. Get the template.** With no answers file there is nothing to read it from — **ask the user which template to adopt** and do not guess one.

**1. Infer the answers.** Read the template's `copier.yml` for the questions it actually asks, then answer each from what the project already is. Every template's question set differs; the pattern is always *find the fact in the repo, don't ask the user to retype it*:

| Question about | Read it from |
| --- | --- |
| Project / package name | the manifest's name field, and the real source directory |
| Description, author, version | the manifest's metadata |
| License | the `LICENSE` file, or none |
| Language / runtime version | the version pin file, else the manifest's requires-field |
| Which assistant | which instruction file exists — `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, an editor's ignore file |
| Optional features | whether the artifacts they generate are already present |

Show the filled table and **confirm before generating**: a wrong package name renders the whole template into the wrong path.

**2. Render a baseline into a scratch directory**, never over the project:

```
uvx --with jinja2-time copier copy --trust --defaults --data-file <scratch>/answers.yml <template> <scratch>/baseline
```

The template's `_tasks` run in there — typically a `git init`, a dependency install, a format pass. Harmless, but it takes a minute.

**3. Merge the baseline into the project** file by file, under the Phase 2 rule. Files the project lacks get added; files it has get merged; nothing is overwritten wholesale.

**4. Take `.copier-answers.yml` from `<scratch>/baseline`** — it already records the correct `_src_path` and `_commit`. From here the project is an ordinary Copier subproject and Phases 0–4 work on it.

**5. Verify and report** as in Phases 3–4, and say plainly which template files were adopted and which were skipped as inapplicable.
