# obsidian-vault

Maintenance and authoring routines for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vaults — formatting, knowledge harvesting into projects, weekly reports by project, structural scanning, accuracy review, wikilink connectivity, file cleanup, inbox ingestion, and authoring or rewriting source-of-truth reference notes.

Every routine defers to [`CONVENTIONS.md`](CONVENTIONS.md) for the shared schema, link rules, heading rules, MOC detection, the folder/archive model, and the deterministic [`scripts/`](scripts). The two authoring routines additionally share [`AUTHORING.md`](AUTHORING.md) for audience, voice, technical standards, diagrams, document shape, and the plan-then-write workflow. The routines validate and edit notes *against* those conventions — and discover the vault's own conventions first when they differ from the defaults.

Deterministic, repeatable checks — broken links, frontmatter schema, footnote integrity, the year sweep, the ISO week number, attachment hygiene — are handled by small stdlib-only Python scripts in [`scripts/`](scripts) rather than re-reasoned each run. The routines read each script's JSON and apply judgment and fixes through the CLI.

## Prerequisites

These routines run inside a **live Obsidian vault**, not a code repo, and reach it through the **`obsidian` CLI** — not an MCP server. Before using this plugin:

1. **Obsidian must be open** on the target vault while a routine runs (the CLI talks to the running app so the live index, daily-note config, and wikilink resolution stay correct).
2. **The `obsidian` CLI must be installed.** It ships as the `obsidian-cli` skill from [`kepano/obsidian-skills`](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-skills). Run `obsidian help` to confirm it's available and to see the authoritative command list.
3. **Python 3.9+** must be on `PATH` for the deterministic [`scripts/`](scripts). They use the standard library only — nothing to `pip install`.

Structural moves the CLI doesn't cover (archiving notes, relocating attachments, deleting consumed captures) operate on the vault folder directly with the filesystem tools.

## Routines

Lighter, everyday operations are **skills** (auto-trigger on natural language); periodic whole-vault audits are **commands** (invoke deliberately); the mechanical file-level cleanup runs as an **agent** (a subagent with its own context, delegated to on request).

### Skills

- **vault-daily-format** — Normalize today's daily report: frontmatter, atomic tasks, self-explanatory completed items, titled links. Never changes substance or language.
- **vault-inbox-ingest** — Empty the Inbox: merge each raw capture into the right note (or create one), relocate its images, wire into a MOC, delete the consumed capture.
- **vault-weekly-harvest** — Extract project-relevant knowledge from unprocessed weekly reports into project notes, marking each report harvested.
- **vault-weekly-report** — Synthesize this week's daily reports grouped by project, store in `Weekly/`, and archive the dailies.
- **vault-note-create** — Author a new source-of-truth reference note on a subject: plan scope and table of contents first, then on approval write a deep, modern engineering-handbook note.
- **vault-note-rewrite** — Refactor and expand informal or fragmented notes into a source-of-truth reference note: audit and plan first, then on approval rewrite.
- **vault-moc-create** — Build a Map of Content (MOC) for a domain — or restructure one — grouping its notes into sections of wikilinks. The canonical MOC routine the authoring and inbox skills defer to.

### Commands

- **/vault-accuracy-review** — Verify every claim in every note (excluding Logs and the archive) and stamp each with a `reviewed` date.
- **/vault-structural-scan** — Fix broken wikilinks, misplaced files, frontmatter errors, stale MOCs, plus dead weight (stubs, orphans, duplicates, empty notes).
- **/vault-wikilink-sprint** — Add inline prose wikilinks between conceptually related notes, starting at the most-referenced hub notes.

### Agent

- **vault-cleanup** — Mechanical file-level hygiene, run as a subagent: rename image attachments to the naming convention and rewrite their links, convert stray markdown links to wikilinks, report orphan/broken attachments, and prune empty folders. The file-level counterpart to `/vault-structural-scan`; it orchestrates the attachment/link/folder scripts, planning before every apply and flagging deletions rather than making them.

## Scripts

The deterministic helpers in [`scripts/`](scripts) (stdlib-only Python, JSON output) back the routines' repeatable checks:

- **`iso_week.py`** — ISO-8601 Monday-anchored week label and the week's dates.
- **`year_sweep.py`** — plan or `--apply` the Weekly→Archive year sweep.
- **`check_links.py`** — broken wikilinks, and `--orphans`.
- **`validate_frontmatter.py`** — schema violations per note.
- **`check_footnotes.py`** — footnote reference/definition mismatches.
- **`vault_clean.py`** — the universal file-cleaner: one command with composable operations (`--rename`, `--dedupe`, `--relink`, `--links`, `--attachments`, `--prune`, or `--all`) and shared modifiers (`--apply`, `--include-archive`, `--ext`, `--keep`). The single tool behind the `vault-cleanup` agent.

They **report** (the routine decides and fixes); the mutating filesystem operations — `year_sweep`, and `vault_clean`'s `--rename`/`--dedupe`/`--relink`/`--links`/`--prune` — plan by default and act on `--apply`. Invoke from the plugin root with `--vault` pointing at the vault, e.g. `python "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/check_links.py" --vault /path/to/vault --orphans`.

## Conventions

See [`CONVENTIONS.md`](CONVENTIONS.md) for the full specification. In brief: per-type YAML frontmatter with ISO dates, `[[wikilinks]]` for internal references, no body H1, one concept per file, a daily/weekly/archive folder model with a self-healing year sweep, and a hard rule never to change a note's language or meaning.
